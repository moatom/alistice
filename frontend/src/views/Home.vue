      <h2>Welcome to Alistice!</h2>
      Alistice is a web application which enables you to more organizationally
      manage your bookmarks on the cloud. This is very useful for a person who
      stacks a lot of old and messy resources in a web browser.<br />
      <br />
      However, it is basically intended for me to personally use this service,
      so the service has two problems: not running on a robust environment and
      slow development. If you can support me, please contact me via
      some ways like Twitter's DM for me to deal with the problems.<br />

      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      Create your account, then set out automatic importation of local bookmarks
      using this script.<br />
      A shifted click works for a range selection.
